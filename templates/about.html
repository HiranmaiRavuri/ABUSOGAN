        <h1>🚨 GAN-Based AI System for Detecting Abuse, Unlawful Activities, and Suspicious Behavior in Surveillance Video Streams</h1>
      
        <p>
            <b>AbusoGAN</b> is an advanced Artificial Intelligence–based surveillance system designed to automatically
            detect abuse, unlawful activities, and suspicious behaviors in real-time video streams. With the rapid
            increase in surveillance cameras across public and private spaces, manual monitoring has become inefficient,
            error-prone, and resource-intensive. AbusoGAN addresses this challenge by leveraging deep learning techniques
            to provide intelligent, automated security monitoring. 🧠📹
        </p>

        <h2>🔍 Core Concept</h2>
        <p>
            The core idea behind AbusoGAN is to analyze visual patterns in video frames and identify abnormal or
            violent activities such as assault, robbery, vandalism, abuse, explosions, and fighting. Instead of relying
            solely on predefined rules, the system learns complex patterns directly from data, enabling it to adapt to
            real-world scenarios with higher accuracy and robustness.
        </p>

        <h2>⚙️ Technologies Used</h2>
        <p>
            AbusoGAN integrates multiple cutting-edge technologies:
            <br><br>
            🔹 <b>Deep Learning & CNNs</b>: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are used to extract spatial features from video frames. These features capture motion, posture, and interaction cues.
            <br><br>
            🔹 <b>Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)</b>: GANs help in modeling normal behavior patterns and detecting anomalies by learning data distributions more effectively.
            <br><br>
            🔹 <b>PyTorch</b>: Used for building and training the deep learning model due to its flexibility and GPU acceleration.
            <br><br>
            🔹 <b>Flask</b>: A lightweight web framework that provides a user-friendly interface for uploading images, viewing predictions, and managing users.
            <br><br>
            🔹 <b>SQLite</b>: Used for secure and persistent user authentication and login management.
        </p>

        <h2>🚀 System Workflow</h2>
        <p>
            First, video frames are captured or uploaded and preprocessed to match the model’s input size.
            The trained neural network then analyzes the frames and classifies the activity into predefined categories.
            Once a suspicious or violent activity is detected, the system displays the detected class along with a
            description and suggested preventive remedies. This helps security personnel take quick and informed actions.
        </p>

        <h2>🛡️ Applications</h2>
        <p>
            AbusoGAN can be deployed in public surveillance systems, shopping malls, smart cities, transportation hubs,
            banks, schools, and industrial areas. By enabling early threat detection, it significantly enhances public
            safety, reduces crime response time, and supports law enforcement agencies. 🚓🏙️
