        <h1>🚨 GAN-Based AI System for Detecting Abuse, Unlawful Activities, and Suspicious Behavior in Surveillance Video Streams</h1>
      
        <p>
            <b>AbusoGAN</b> is an intelligent Artificial Intelligence–based surveillance system developed to automatically detect abuse, unlawful activities, and suspicious behavior from video inputs. With the rapid growth of surveillance systems across public and private environments, manual monitoring has become inefficient, time-consuming, and prone to human error. AbusoGAN addresses this challenge by combining deep learning algorithms with intelligent video analysis to provide automated and reliable security monitoring. The system analyzes uploaded video footage, processes frames, and predicts activity categories to assist security personnel in decision-making. 
        </p>

        <h2>🔍 Core Concept</h2>
        <p>
            The core idea behind AbusoGAN is to analyze visual patterns present in video frames and recognize suspicious or abnormal activities such as assault, robbery, vandalism, abuse, explosions, and fighting. Instead of relying on fixed rule-based detection, the system learns meaningful visual representations from training data using deep learning. This allows the model to generalize effectively and perform reliable activity classification even in complex real-world scenarios.
        </p>

        <h2>⚙️ Technologies Used</h2>
        <p>
            AbusoGAN integrates multiple advanced technologies to perform intelligent activity detection.
            <br><br>
            🔹 <b>Deep Learning & CNNs</b>: Convolutional Neural Networks are used to extract spatial features from video frames, enabling the system to understand motion patterns, object interactions, and human behavior.
            <br><br>
            🔹 <b>Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)</b>: GAN concepts are applied during training to enhance data representation and improve model learning capability.
            <br><br>
            🔹 <b>PyTorch</b>: Used for implementing and running the deep learning model efficiently.
            <br><br>
            🔹 <b>Flask</b>: Provides a lightweight web interface for uploading videos and viewing predictions.
            <br><br>
            🔹 <b>SQLite</b>: Ensures secure storage and authentication of user login information.
        </p>

        <h2>🚀 System Workflow</h2>
        <p>
            The system workflow begins when a user uploads a video file through the web interface. The video is processed and converted into frames, which are resized and normalized before being analyzed by the trained deep learning model. Each frame is classified individually, and the final prediction is determined using majority voting across all frames. The system then displays the detected activity along with a description and recommended preventive measures, allowing users to quickly understand the situation and take appropriate action.
        </p>

        <h2>🛡️ Applications</h2>
        <p>
            AbusoGAN can be deployed in various real-world environments such as public surveillance systems, transportation hubs, shopping malls, smart cities, schools, banks, and industrial facilities. By automatically identifying suspicious activities and abnormal behavior, the system helps improve public safety, enhances monitoring efficiency, and supports security teams in responding quickly to potential threats.
