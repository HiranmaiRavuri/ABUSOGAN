# AbusoGAN — GAN-Based AI System for Detecting Abuse and Suspicious Activities

## Overview

**AbusoGAN** is an intelligent surveillance analysis system developed to detect abuse, unlawful activities, and suspicious behavior from video streams. The system integrates GAN-assisted training with a CNN-based classifier to improve activity recognition accuracy and reliability.

---

## Methodology

The system follows a two-stage deep learning approach:

**Training Phase**

* GAN concepts are used to enhance training quality and data representation
* Improves feature learning and model robustness

**Detection Phase**

* A trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) analyzes video frames
* Predicts activity classes
* Final output is generated using majority voting across frames

---

## Features

* Automated suspicious activity detection
* Video-based multi-class classification
* Intelligent surveillance monitoring
* Secure authentication system
* Result explanation with safety recommendations

## Technologies Used

Python • PyTorch • OpenCV • Flask • HTML/CSS • SQLite • GAN • CNN

---

## Detected Activities

Abuse, Assault, Fighting, Robbery, Shooting, Explosion, Burglary, Shoplifting, Stealing, Vandalism, Road Accidents, Arrest, Arson, Normal Activity

---

## How to Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HiranmaiRavuri/ABUSOGAN.git
cd ABUSOGAN
pip install -r requirements.txt
python check.py
```

---

## Objective
